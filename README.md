# Snake Game

An enhanced version of the classic Snake game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake's movement (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats food (red circle).
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Turtle module** (comes pre-installed with Python)
